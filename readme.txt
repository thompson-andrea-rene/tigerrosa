This is my project for the Code Kentucky Fall 2022.  The website is designed for a small craft business to display products and promote upcoming events.  

The feature requirements that the project fullifilles are:
1. Create a responsive menu with JavaScript - The navagation menu at the top of the screen is the "hamburger style" menu that responds to change in screen sizes by changing format.  
2. Create accordion boxes to display different types of information - The FAQ section of the website shows three accordion style boxes.  
3. Add your own transition animation(s) to an element on hover - In the top menu the names change color when they are hovered over.
